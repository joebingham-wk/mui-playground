## Just an example app..

This is a simple create-react-app with MUI that is meant to act as a baseline for the discovery work being done in https://github.com/aaronlademann-wf/react_material_ui.

This app as a whole can be compared to the example app introduced in https://github.com/Workiva/over_react/pull/617.

The benefit of having this project is to compare the DOM between the Dart version of the example (in over_react) and the vanilla JavaScript version.

For styles, not only can IDs be compared to each other in situations where they should match, but it provides the opportunity to step through a JS app and compare
the same devtool steps in the Dart version.
